=head1 DESCRIPTION

Increases the distribution's version according to the semantic versioning rules
(see L<http://semver.org/>) by inspecting the changelog.

More specifically, the plugin performs the following actions:

=over

=item at build time

Reads the changelog using C<CPAN::Changes> and filters out of the C<{{$NEXT}}>
release section any group without item.

=item before a release

Ensures that there is at least one recorded change in the changelog, and
increments the version number in consequence.   If there are changes given
outside of the sections, they are considered to be minor.

=item after a release

Updates the new C<{{$NEXT}}> section of the changelog with placeholders for
all the change categories.  With categories as given in the I<SYNOPSIS>,
this would look like

    {{$NEXT}}

      [MAJOR]

      [API CHANGE]

      [MINOR]

      [ENHANCEMENTS]

      [REVISION]

      [BUG FIXES]

=back

If a version is given via the environment variable C<V>, it will taken
as-if as the next version.

For this plugin to work, your L<Dist::Zilla> configuration must also contain a plugin
consuming the L<Dist::Zilla::Role::YANICK::PreviousVersionProvider> role.
